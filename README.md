# Stock_market_prediction
Introduction

The project aims to develop an AI-based trading prediction that automates stock trading decisions using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques.
It introduces sentiment analysis based on past news to enhance traditional trading models, providing real-time insights into market movements.
By integrating these approaches, it seeks to increase trading efficiency and potentially improve profitability in dynamic financial markets.

Objectives

Analyze different trading algorithms Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Z-Score to analyse performance matrices.
Long term Price Prediction using LSTM machine learning model and Google Collab.
Implement sentiment analysis.
Comparison of LSTM Model Performance With and Without News Sentiment Analysis

Activate Virtual environment in python and install the :
Libraries used :
1.  **fsspec:** `pip install fsspec`
2.  **streamlit:** `pip install streamlit`
3.  **yfinance:** `pip install yfinance`
4.  **pandas:** `pip install pandas`
5.  **plotly:** `pip install plotly`
6.  **numpy:** `pip install numpy`
7.  **tensorflow:** `pip install tensorflow` (or `pip install tensorflow-gpu` if you want GPU support and have the necessary drivers installed)
8.  **scikit-learn:** `pip install scikit-learn`
9.  **beautifulsoup4:** `pip install beautifulsoup4` (The import `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup` implies this)
10. **requests:** `pip install requests`
11. **matplotlib:** `pip install matplotlib`
12. **torch:** `pip install torch` (The specific installation command for PyTorch might vary depending on your system configuration and whether you need CUDA support. It's best to refer to the official PyTorch website for the exact command: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/]([invalid%20URL%20removed]))
13. **transformers:** `pip install transformers`

Therefore, to run this script, you would need to ensure that all these libraries are installed in your Python environment using `pip`.
